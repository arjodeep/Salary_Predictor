This is a beginner-level Machine Learning web application that predicts a person’s expected monthly salary based on their years of experience.
It uses Linear Regression, trained on a dataset from Kaggle. The final model is integrated with a Flask web app where users can input their experience and get salary predictions.

✅ This is my first end-to-end ML + Web Development project! I built it to learn how machine learning models are deployed in real-world applications.
